# You can use the same builtin types as generics (with square brackets and types inside):

# * list
# * tuple
# * set
# * dict

# And the same as with Python 3.8, from the typing module:

# Union
# Optional (the same as with Python 3.8)
# ...and others.

# In Python 3.10, as an alternative to using the generics "Union" and "Optional",
#  you can use the vertical bar (|) to declare unions of types, that's a lot better and simpler.
